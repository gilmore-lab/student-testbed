#  What is the illusory vowel? 

The illusory vowel occurs when native Spanish speakers hear words that start with the consonant pattern /#sC/.  Previous research has indicated that when native Spanish speakers learn English, a language in which approximately 6% of all words begin with /#sC/, they hallucinate that the word actually begins with /esC/. For example, when someone says "school", they hear "eschool". Research has shown that as Spanish speakers become more fluent in English, the illusory vowel diminishes.  

My PIRE study aims to find out exactly when the illusory vowel occurs.  

# Methods 

The study will take place in Granada, Spain.  There will be 60 participants: 30 near-monolingual Spanish speakers and 30 Spanish-English bilinguals.
